      <div class="meta">Mon, May 5, 2014</div>
    </header>

    Here are some of my notes from learning rails. I am following the course Web Application Architectures at Coursera. This is seen from perspective of someone used to more desktop applications. I used Ruby as a scripting language for writing small unix tools in the past, but I am not considering myself very up to date. Setup Project Have rails autogenerate a bunch of files for a project: $ rails new myproject This seems to be the way to create a new model class with corresponding table in database: $ rails generate scaffold comment post_id:integer body:text This will to a whole bunch of things.

      <div class="meta">Sun, May 4, 2014</div>
    </header>

    The heartbleed exploit made me thing of my own way of keeping passwords which relies on 1Password. What was painfull with 1Password was having to regenerate every single password I have over again. That is a lot of work. The second problem because all my passwords are too hard to remember, I am screwed if I ever lose my encrypted database of passwords. So I also make paper copies, but they have to be made secure as well, so they can not be used directly in their paper form.

    </header>

    Economic Simulation The idea is to simulate economy in a similar way to how games do it. My first interest is to study comparative advantage and economics of scale. My hypothesis is that minor differences in efficiency of producing a good will over time get amplified. The economic model is based on the assumption that large factories has a larger production capacity, require less work per item to produce but has a higher fixed cost than smaller factories.

      <h2><a href='http://translusion.github.com/posts/avrdevboard'> Development board for 8 pin AVR microcontrollers</a> </h2>
      <div class="meta">Sun, Mar 24, 2013</div>
    </header>

    I got a bunch of ATtiny13 AVR microcontroller chips because I tought it would be fun to see what you can do with a tiny 8 pin microcontroller. The thought first popped into my mind when I looked at a project for creating motor controller for an electric spinning wheel. The project used the same chip as in an arduino with an arduino bootloader. The ATmega328 is a lot more expensive than a ATtiny13.

    This is a distilation of my last weeks of experience building an AVR curcuit on a breadboard and prototype board and programming it in assembly. Look at one of my previous post to see how you get up to speed with the assembler, avrdude for transfering programs etc. Continuity Buzzer When I wanted to check whether to points on my circuit were connected before I turned my multimeter on measuring resistance (power turned off of course).

      <h2><a href='http://translusion.github.com/posts/avrassembly'> AVR Assembly programming on Mac OS X</a> </h2>
      <div class="meta">Tue, Mar 5, 2013</div>
    </header>

    When starting with out programming the AVR microcontroller on OS X, you will probably start by using CrossPack. However the problem with that is it doesn&rsquo;t come with a compiler meant to be used directly by you. It is mainly there for the C compiler. CrossPack installs the AVR GNU assembler avr-as described here. The assembly files typically end with .S. You can invoke it through gcc with e.g. avr-gcc -Wall -Os -DF_CPU=8000000 -mmcu=attiny13 -x assembler-with-cpp -c ledflash.S This will assemble the file ledflash.S for the AVR microcontroller unit (MCU) ATtiny13.

      <h2><a href='http://translusion.github.com/posts/avr_without_arduino'> Getting started with AVR programming</a> </h2>
      <div class="meta">Fri, Mar 1, 2013</div>

    After Arduino So you tried Arduino programming. It is a great way to get introduced to Microcontrollers. But if you are actually an experienced programmer it doesn&rsquo;t quite feel like the real thing. It is sort of like learning BASIC when you know there is this other thing real programmers use which is C. Arduino is built around the AVR microcontroller. It simplifies a lot by providing a USB port on the board itself and having a loaded program to load your program into the memory of the AVR microcontroller.
