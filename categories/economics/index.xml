&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Economic Simulation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to simulate economy in a similar way to how games do it. My first interest is to study comparative advantage and economics of scale. My hypothesis is that minor differences in efficiency of producing a good will over time get amplified. The economic model is based on the assumption that large factories has a larger production capacity, require less work per item to produce but has a higher fixed cost than smaller factories.
Whatever economy starts producing more of a particular good will eventually invest in larger factories, leading to a stronger comparative advantage in that area and pushing other countries or competitors towards investing in production of other goods. Thus a diversitication happens.&lt;/p&gt;
