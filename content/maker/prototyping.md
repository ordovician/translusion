Lets say you want to test out an idea for a robot car, DVD changing robot arm, automatic card sorter or something similar. Machining your own parts would be time consuming. So what are the options for rapid prototyping?

    
## Lego Mindstorm

This is probably the best known option. The advantage is that it is easy to get hold of and there are lots of people using lego mindstorm so it is easy to find resources online.

The downside is that Lego is its own little world. It is harder to get Lego to fit with standard industrial components. It is more expensive to buy a Lego DC motor or sensor than a standard one.

## Meccano

Not as easily accessible and known as Lego, but a fair amount of stores still sell Meccano kits. In Norway you can find Meccano at:

* [Clas Ohlson][clas]
* [Riktige Leker][riktigleker]
* Teknisk Museum

It is slower to put together things with Meccano than with Lego but the benefit is that the same approach for connecting things as "real" objects: screws and nuts. So you can more easily connect it to standard industrial components.

It also give a more solid construction, which you could keep as the final version if you want to.

## Fischertechnik

Has some resemblance to Lego in that it is based on plastic pieces. A down side to using [fischertechnik][fischertechnik] is that it is far less known than Lego. So there are less resources available online and you can't just walk into any toy store and buy [fischertechnik][fischertechnik].

However I personally think [fischertechnik][fischertechnik] is the superior prototyping system. It works very similar to standard industrial prototyping systems based on [T-slots][tnut].

Lego is well suited for building the same things that you would build with bricks such as houses and buildings. Lego technik or Mindstorm tries to expand on that by offering pieces which connect in a similar fashion as Meccano by having regularly spaced holes in the bricks.

A downside to that is that pieces can only be connected at fixed points. [Fischertechnik][fischertechnik] pieces on the other hand may be connected at any point. A standard building block can connect to another standard building block at any of the block's six faces. That gives versatility which can not be matched by either Meccano or Lego. [Fischertechnik][fischertechnik] well suited for constructing machnines but poorly suited for making things resembling builds. Lego is better suited for this.

## MakerBeam

A [T-slot][tnut] system for small hobby sized constructions. [T-slots][tnut] used in the industry is usually 20x20mm, which is impractical for a hobbyist. [MakerBeam][makerbeam] is 10x10mm which is far more practical. 

It is not sold as a toy like Lego, Meccano and Fischertechnik however. Using it requires more knowledge. There are no ready made kits with instructions.[MakerBeams][makerbeam] are really just beams, brackets and screws. There are no ready made kits for building particular models. You have to buy industry standard motors, gears etc to make something usefull.

## OpenBeam

Similar to [MakerBeam][makerbeam], but bigger: 15x15mm which is the same size as a standard [fischertechnik][fischertechnik] building block. However the advantage [OpenBeam][openbeam] has over other forms of [T-slots][tnut] or aluminum extrusions is that they have been designed to be used with regular nuts and bolts. This is a great advantage because the specialized nuts and bolts used with other aluminium extrusions are often costly and hard to get by.
