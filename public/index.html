      <h2><a href='http://translusion.github.com/posts/swift-is-kotlin'> Swift is Kotlin</a> </h2>
      <div class="meta">Thu, Jun 5, 2014</div>
    </header>

    Around the internet people are saying Apple&rsquo;s Swift looks like C#, JavaScript etc. This of course is just in the most superficial manner. E.g. both JavaScript and Swift has the var keyword. But it means completely different things since Swift is statically typed and JavaScript is not. Anyway being generally curious about programming languages I could see similarities in Swift with Rust, Go, Scala and Ruby. However all these languages differ from Swift in quite a number of ways.

      <div class="meta">Wed, Jun 4, 2014</div>
    </header>

    While the US isn&rsquo;t the richest country in the world in per capita GDP, it is by far the richest large country. It can boast of impressive results in science and innovation. Does that mean that anyone whishing to obtain similar levels of prosperity have to follow the American model for economic system and organization of society? My short answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. The US is an outlier which has too many advantages not related to the organization of its economy or society.

      <div class="meta">Tue, Jun 3, 2014</div>
    </header>

    It is populare with peeing contests between America and Europe either in terms of GDP numbers, level of development, education, crime and what not. Of course regardless of how entertaining these sort of comparisons are, they are essentially apple to oranges comparisons. Europeans might score points by pointing to a number of of smaller European countries with very favorable statistics in a number of areas such as unemployment, human development index, crime rates, GDP etc.

      <div class="meta">Sun, May 11, 2014</div>
    </header>

    I&rsquo;ve recently performed a survey at my work using Google form, unfortunatle the data wasn&rsquo;t usable right out of the box, because it mycompanyallowed people to register an answer multiple times, but one person should just have one vote. I chose to clean the data with [the Julia programming language][julia], which might not be the best choice for this sort of thing. Not because julia isn&rsquo;t suited but because SQL, sed or awk might do such a specialized and simple task faster.

      <h2><a href='http://translusion.github.com/posts/learning-rails'> Learning Web Development with Rails</a> </h2>
      <div class="meta">Mon, May 5, 2014</div>
    </header>

    Here are some of my notes from learning rails. I am following the course Web Application Architectures at Coursera. This is seen from perspective of someone used to more desktop applications. I used Ruby as a scripting language for writing small unix tools in the past, but I am not considering myself very up to date. Setup Project Have rails autogenerate a bunch of files for a project: $ rails new myproject This seems to be the way to create a new model class with corresponding table in database: $ rails generate scaffold comment post_id:integer body:text This will to a whole bunch of things.

      <h2><a href='http://translusion.github.com/posts/dulgt-intro'> Deterministic Password Generator</a> </h2>
      <div class="meta">Sun, May 4, 2014</div>
    </header>

    The heartbleed exploit made me thing of my own way of keeping passwords which relies on 1Password. What was painfull with 1Password was having to regenerate every single password I have over again. That is a lot of work. The second problem because all my passwords are too hard to remember, I am screwed if I ever lose my encrypted database of passwords. So I also make paper copies, but they have to be made secure as well, so they can not be used directly in their paper form.

      <h2><a href='http://translusion.github.com/projects/econsim'> Economics Simulator</a> </h2>
      <div class="meta">Fri, Mar 28, 2014</div>
    </header>

    Economic Simulation The idea is to simulate economy in a similar way to how games do it. My first interest is to study comparative advantage and economics of scale. My hypothesis is that minor differences in efficiency of producing a good will over time get amplified. The economic model is based on the assumption that large factories has a larger production capacity, require less work per item to produce but has a higher fixed cost than smaller factories.
