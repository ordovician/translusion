        This section contains the content of our home page.

        I have broken it into three main sections:
          (1) about the blog
          (2) about me
          (3) Recent posts

        The first two sections are pretty self explanatory.

        In the recent posts section we ask Hugo to use the template found in
        /layouts/posts/summary.html to show a summary of the 10 most recent
        posts we have made.

        <p>I am interested in too many things combined with limited memory. So I got this site to write down articles about things I find interesting as well as projects I have done.</p>
